<h2>ABC AUTOMOBILE SALES DASHBOARD<h2>

<h4>Problem Statement<h4>
ABC Automobile is a manufacturing company that sells all kinds of automobiles and lately they have been noticing that some areas are performing better than others. As of now, the company does not have any data tools that offer some transparency to the managers making this process quite tedious. After some deep evaluation and feasibility process, the managers at ABC Automobile decided to reach out to Prerana's Company to help them build a Data Driven solution which will help them understand sales trend and come up with better future strategies for sales growth. 
<h4>Solution<h4>
The company has decided to deliver a Sales Dashboard using Power BI technology.  Prerana's Company suggested creating the dashboards on Power BI for better insights and self-service capabilities. ABC Automobile would like that the Power BI Dashboard is published on a workspace in the Power BI Service so that the managers can share and edit as they wish. The company together with Prerana's Company have gathered a list of parameters and Key performance indicators (KPIs) that they would like to be existent in the Power BI Dashboard. 
<h4>Step- 1<h4>
